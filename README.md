# Sarcastic-Reminder

Sarcastic Reminder is a Chrome extension that helps to improve your productivity online. Users are assumed to have both Google Calendar and Rescuetime account because we use their APIs.

When you go online, Sarcastic Reminder detects how productive you are through requesting and processing the Rescuetime's API data. It also connects to your Google calendar through their APIs to identify if you have any upcoming exams. Based on the urgency of your exam schedule and your productivity level, Sarcastic Reminder will create humorous and sarcastic but also very meaningful messages/reminders, motivating you to be the most productive version of yourself.
